# Terrain Sketching
Procedural Terrain Generation using Sketch for my Computer Graphics Course (CSE 528)

This is a project that is a work in progress. This will allow users to sketch the terrain in space, as if using Paint, and then generate a procedural terrain within those constraints. The noise that is defined in the silhouette terrain line will then be propagated throughout the landform to create a realistic landform.

The interface is divided into 3 modes which can be switched using **M**. These are:
## Base Mode
This is the mode where the x-z boundaries can be defined

## Height Mode
Here the user can define the spine curves of the terrain.

## Perlin Mode
The user sees the generated terrains.

All the modes provide the user to move around. For faster movement, use the arrow and the page up/down keys. For a more controlled movement use the w, a, s, d keys. To strafe up and down use the r and f keys.
