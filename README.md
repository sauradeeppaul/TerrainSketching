# Terrain Sketching
Procedural Terrain Generation using Sketch for my Computer Graphics Course (CSE 528)

This is a project that is a work in progress. This will allow users to sketch the terrain in space, as if using Paint, and then generate a prcedural terrain within those constraints. The noise that is defined in the silhouette terrain line will then be propagated throughout the landform to create a realistic landform.
